## If you've decided to join:

1.  Check out [the Official Site](http://100daysofcode.com/) for the #100DaysOfCode movement. Connect with others on the platform of your choice from this list: www.100DaysOfCode.com/connect
2.  Read [Join the #100DaysOfCode](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/join-the-100daysofcode-556ddb4579e4)
3.  **Code minimum an hour every day for the next 100 days.**
4.  **Encourage at least two other people in the challenge on Twitter every day! Pay it forward!**
5.  **Tweet your progress every day using the #100DaysOfCode hashtag.**
6.  Follow [Alex, creator of #100DaysOfCode](https://twitter.com/ka11away) & [100DaysOfCode](https://twitter.com/_100DaysOfCode) Twitter Bot that retweets the tweets that contain the #100DaysOfCode hashtag. It's a great way to keep yourself motivated and to participate in the community. 
Thanks [@amanhimself](https://twitter.com/amanhimself) for creating it!
7.  Important: (see No.4 above for a specific rule on this) Encourage others who are doing the same challenge on Twitter or elsewhere - by giving them props when they are posting updates on their progress, supporting them when things get difficult. Thus we will grow a community that is helpful and effective, which will lead to a higher success rate for each person involved. It's also more likely that you will stick to your own commitment, given that you will get acquainted with a couple people (or more) right away.
